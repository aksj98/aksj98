### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Broadly interested in enjoying life and working on stuff that doesn't really feel like work :) 
- Currently training SAEs and doing some safety research in LLMs
- Previously trained voice in, voice out architectures into LLMs, explored diffusion models for robotics
- Non-GenAI stuff - built sentiment analysis models for chatbots for enterprises, fraud detection models for banks, built B2C apps that got to thousands of users
- Broader interests that I haven't been able to deep dive into: MCTS/Self-refinement in LLMs, Flow-matching, SSMs, alternative hardware architectures for ML, validators for LLMs, long-context windows
